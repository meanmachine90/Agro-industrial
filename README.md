Here is the programming task to develop:
- Create a Django project
- Set up a connection to a PostgreSQL database
- Create a simple model called bank to represent a community bank
- Create a simple model called client to represent a person tied to a bank
- Create one web view that lists each bank with the clients tied to that bank


please run the following command to get the virtual env using cmd on the main project folder

for the data I create a fake information, importing the data to PostgreSQL 

I attached such files in case you needed.
